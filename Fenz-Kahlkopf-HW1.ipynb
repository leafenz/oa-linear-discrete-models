    "# Introduction\n",
    "In this project, we develop a **linear and mixed-integer optimization model** for the weekly scheduling of hospital staff.  \n",
    "The goal is to assign doctors, nurses, and other healthcare workers to morning, afternoon, and night shifts while minimizing total staffing costs and respecting multiple operational and human constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset `hospital_staff.csv` contains information about 20 employees, including:\n",
    "- Role, gender, and experience level  \n",
    "- Maximum weekly working hours  \n",
    "- Hourly cost  \n",
    "- Individual availability and shift preferences  \n",
    "\n",
    "This model helps hospital administrators create efficient and fair schedules that:\n",
    "- Guarantee the required number of staff in every shift,  \n",
    "- Respect employees’ availability and workload limits,  \n",
    "- Avoid infeasible or unfair assignments,  \n",
    "- Minimize the total labor cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "In part (a), we formulate the **linear programming (LP)** version of the problem.  \n",
    "In part (b), we implement and solve the model using realistic data.  \n",
    "In part (c), we analyze **sensitivities (shadow prices)** to understand how changes in constraints affect costs.  \n",
    "Finally, in part (d), we extend the model to a **mixed-integer programming (MIP)** version by adding logical and conditional constraints such as rest periods after night shifts and maximum weekly work limits.\n"
